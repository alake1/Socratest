[{"question": "Which type of rock is formed from the cooling and solidification of molten rock?", "options": ["Sedimentary", "Metamorphic", "Igneous", "All of the above"], "correctOption": 2, "explanation": "Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma (underground) or lava (above ground)."}, {"question": "What is the name of the process by which rocks are broken down into smaller pieces?", "options": ["Erosion", "Weathering", "Deposition", "Compaction"], "correctOption": 1, "explanation": "Weathering is the process of breaking down rocks into smaller pieces through physical or chemical means."}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a type of sedimentary rock?", "options": ["Sandstone", "Limestone", "Granite", "Shale"], "correctOption": 2, "explanation": "Granite is an igneous rock, while Sandstone, Limestone, and Shale are all types of sedimentary rocks."}, {"question": "What is the name of the process that transforms existing rocks into new rocks due to heat and pressure?", "options": ["Weathering", "Erosion", "Metamorphism", "Deposition"], "correctOption": 2, "explanation": "Metamorphism is the process where existing rocks are transformed due to heat and pressure, often deep within the Earth\u2019s crust."}, {"question": "Which type of plate boundary is associated with the formation of new oceanic crust?", "options": ["Convergent", "Divergent", "Transform", "Subduction"], "correctOption": 1, "explanation": "Divergent plate boundaries are where plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and create new oceanic crust."}, {"question": "What is the name of the supercontinent that existed about ,million years ago?", "options": ["Laurasia", "Gondwana", "Pangaea", "Rodinia"], "correctOption": 2, "explanation": "Pangaea was the supercontinent that existed about ,million years ago, before breaking apart into the continents we know today."}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a type of volcano?", "options": ["Shield", "Cinder cone", "Composite", "Geyser"], "correctOption": 3, "explanation": "Geysers are hot springs that erupt periodically, not volcanoes. Shield, Cinder cone, and Composite are all types of volcanoes."}, {"question": "What is the name of the process by which the Earth\u2019s magnetic field flips?", "options": ["Magnetic reversal", "Magnetic declination", "Magnetic inclination", "Magnetic field intensity"], "correctOption": 0, "explanation": "Magnetic reversal is the process where the Earth\u2019s magnetic field flips, with the north and south magnetic poles switching places."}, {"question": "Which of the following is a major cause of earthquakes?", "options": ["Volcanic eruptions", "Plate tectonics", "Erosion", "Weathering"], "correctOption": 1, "explanation": "Plate tectonics is the primary cause of earthquakes, as the movement and interaction of tectonic plates create stress and strain that can release energy in the form of seismic waves."}, {"question": "What is the name of the scale used to measure the intensity of an earthquake?", "options": ["Richter scale", "Mercalli scale", "Beaufort scale", "Saffir-Simpson scale"], "correctOption": 1, "explanation": "The Mercalli scale measures the intensity of an earthquake based on its effects on people and structures."}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a type of fossil?", "options": ["Trace fossil", "Body fossil", "Mineral fossil", "Petrified fossil"], "correctOption": 2, "explanation": "Mineral fossils are not a distinct type of fossil. Trace fossils, body fossils, and petrified fossils are all recognized types of fossils."}, {"question": "What is the name of the process by which fossils are formed?", "options": ["Fossilisation", "Petrification", "Mineralization", "All of the above"], "correctOption": 3, "explanation": "All of the options are involved in the process of fossil formation, which includes the preservation of organic remains through various processes like petrification and mineralization."}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a type of rock found in the Earth\u2019s crust?", "options": ["Igneous", "Sedimentary", "Metamorphic", "Metallic"], "correctOption": 3, "explanation": "Metallic rocks are not a recognized type of rock found in the Earth\u2019s crust. The three main types are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic."}, {"question": "What is the name of the process by which rocks are broken down by the force of water?", "options": ["Abrasion", "Erosion", "Weathering", "Deposition"], "correctOption": 0, "explanation": "Abrasion is the process of rocks being broken down by the force of water carrying sediments and debris."}, {"question": "Which of the following is a type of rock that is often used in building materials?", "options": ["Granite", "Limestone", "Marble", "All of the above"], "correctOption": 3, "explanation": "All of the options are types of rocks commonly used in building materials due to their durability and aesthetic qualities."}, {"question": "What is the name of the layer of the Earth that is composed of molten rock?", "options": ["Crust", "Mantle", "Outer core", "Inner core"], "correctOption": 2, "explanation": "The outer core of the Earth is composed of molten iron and nickel."}, {"question": "Which of the following is a type of mineral that is often used in jewelry?", "options": ["Quartz", "Diamond", "Emerald", "All of the above"], "correctOption": 3, "explanation": "All of the options are types of minerals that are often used in jewelry due to their beauty and durability."}, {"question": "What is the name of the process by which rocks are transported from one location to another?", "options": ["Erosion", "Weathering", "Deposition", "Compaction"], "correctOption": 0, "explanation": "Erosion is the process of rocks being transported from one location to another by forces like wind, water, or ice."}, {"question": "Which of the following is a type of rock that is often used in road construction?", "options": ["Sandstone", "Granite", "Limestone", "All of the above"], "correctOption": 3, "explanation": "All of the options are types of rocks commonly used in road construction due to their durability and availability."}, {"question": "What is the name of the process by which sediments are compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks?", "options": ["Lithification", "Erosion", "Weathering", "Deposition"], "correctOption": 0, "explanation": "Lithification is the process by which sediments are compacted and cemented together, forming sedimentary rocks."}]
